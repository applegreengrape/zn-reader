# 🙋🏾‍♂️ How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in Chinese Reader. If you'd like to contribute, I'm keen to help. Contribution takes many forms, so even if the thought of writing code is a daunting prospect, please read on. If you'd like a little extra support, then please just ask.

First things first, please read the code of conduct. It isn't  long, but it'll give you an idea of what I expect of contributors.

I've outlined the various ways of contributing below. These aren't rules. You won't be chastised if you don't follow them but it helps me keep on top of things if you do.

## ❓ Questions

Yes, questions are a form of contribution. Questions do offer valuable feedback into what works and what doesn't. They challenge the approach and decisions that have been taken. This is healthy, and so if something doesn't make sense. Please ask.

Please don't create an issue for questions. The best way to ask is to reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/billglover) (DMs are open). If you'd prefer a call or video chat, then [book a time](https://calendly.com/billglover/30min).

## 💡 Feature Requests

Have an idea for a new feature? The best way to capture it is to create an Issue here on GitHub. There is a template for feature requests that should get you started. Please remember though, not all new features will be implemented. If I decide not to incorporate a new feature, I'll do my best to explain my reasoning.

## 🐛 Issues or Bugs

If you find something that doesn't work, please create an Issue here on GitHub. There is a template for issues or bugs that will guide you through the process. Please try to complete the template, but don't worry if you don't have answers for everything. If you get stuck, leave a note on the issue to let me know and I'll try and help gather the information I need.

## 👩🏾‍💻 Documentation & Code

If you'd like to work on the documentation or the code for Chinese Reader, that would be awesome. The project is new so there isn't much in the way of process. But I do ask that you follow the guidelines below to ensure that I can keep things manageable.

1. Please ensure there is an Issue describing the bug or feature that you intend to address. Leave a comment on the issue to let me know you intend to work on it.
2. Please [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/working-with-forks) and commit changes to your fork.
3. When you are ready to share your contribution, please create a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests).
4. I will review the Pull Request and may ask clarifying questions or request changes before merging. I intend to keep these requests to a minimum but remember that it is common to see some change after the Pull Request has been raised.

One final thing; not all Pull Requests get merged. In the rare event that I decide not to merge your pull request, I will endeavour to provide an explanation. This does not mean your contribution has not been valuable. 

## 🧹 Housekeeping

When someone offers to work on an issue I'll mark that issue as #claimed using a label. Please don't start work on an issue that is already claimed, but comments on the issue are always welcome.

There are no deadlines for contributions, take as long as you need. I do ask that you leave a comment at least once a week to let me know you are still working on an issue. If an issue goes untouched for a week, I will remove the #claimed label and make it available for others to tackle.

If the number of issues grows to be unmanageable, I may close older issues to keep the focus on current work. I'll try to leave comments against issues before closing them so that the reasoning is clear.

Thank you.
