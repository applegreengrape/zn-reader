# 🇨🇳 Chinese Reader

Build your confidence reading Chinese

Chinese Reader gets you started with reading Chinese in the wild. By highlighting known characters Chinese Reader makes it easy to spot text you'll be able to read.

## 💡 Background

My efforts to learn Chinese have focused on the spoken language. This has allowed me to make limited progress, but on several occasions I've found my inability to read or even recognise characters to be a real barrier. Without the ability to read, I feel unable to take advantage of the incredible language learning opportunities afforded by the internet.

As I slowly increase my vocabulary I find myself put off reading when faced with a wall of dense Chinese text. Character recall can be slow and variations in font faces can lead to frustration. Laziness tends to win out long before I've got past the end of the first sentence. If I knew that I'd recognise the majority of characters in an article, a paragraph, or even a sentence, I suspect I'd be far more willing to give it a go.

To tackle this, I began work on Chinese Reader.

## 📈 Progress

Chinese Reader is a work in progress. Some component pieces are in place but it isn't yet a functioning solution. My initial focus is to release this as a browser plugin, but there are a number of ideas for how this could develop.

* ✅ Detecting Chinese text on web pages
* ✅ Posting Chinese text to the back end
* ✅ Identifying known characters in a string of text
* 🔜 Highlight known strings on a web page (Javascript)
* 🔜 Polish the browser plugin (Javascript / HTML / CSS)
* 🔜 Back end API endpoint (Go)
* 🔜 Calculate readability score (Go)
* 🔜 Data store for lists of known characters / phrases (Go)
